//- Setup navbar links
//- This could probably be done better; it only, for example, allows
//- normal links (no menus, etc.). That said, a full Backbone model and
//- collection, however, would be a bit overkill when there's no
//- meaningful RESTful interaction.

- var links = [];
- links.push({name: 'Home',    href: '#',      });
- links.push({name: 'About',   href: '#about', });
- links.push({name: 'Contact', href: '#contact'});

each link in links
  li(class = link.name == active ? 'active' : undefined)
    a(href = link.href)= link.name
